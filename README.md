# MoronBoxDecursive

A supportive utility to handle decursing in MoronBoxCore. Should be able to be used separately. Based on Decursive, stripped down from all excessive options.

Pretty much decursive but a more lightweight version, removed all the localizations and uninteresting settings.

> Plan is to implement boxing code directly into the addon.
